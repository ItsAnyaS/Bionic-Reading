# Bionic-Reading
An productivity app that uses bionic reading to help neurodivergent people.

The goal of this project is to create an open source, free to use app that help people that stuggle with reading.  A form of reading called Bionic reading boldens parts of words to help create guide the reader to feel more comfortable and focused and it also increases reader speed.

This project at its current state takes an inputed string and returns the Bionic words.  For example, a string 'I love to go to the supermarket' would return 'I LOVE TO GO TO THE SUPERmarket'.
At the moment the program requires you to input the string through the js file but with coming updates the user will be able to enter it through a portal.

I vision for this project would to be able to create a chrome extension that automatically parces in the string data from the page and return the data Bionicalized
